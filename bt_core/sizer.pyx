          - ``snapshot``: a snapshot of the current state of the strategy (see Strategy.snapshot())

        The method has to return a weight map (sid -> ratio, ``0 < ratio < 1``;
        buy: cash fraction spent on the order, sell: fraction of available
        shares to close). If a sid maps to ``0`` (or is absent) nothing will
        be executed for it. Absolute-value clamping to [0, 1] is applied by
        the filler's ``calculate``.
