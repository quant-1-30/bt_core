    '''This analyzer reports the value of the positions of the current set of
    datas

    Params:

      - timeframe (default: ``None``)
        If ``None`` then the timeframe of the 1st data of the system will be
        used

      - compression (default: ``None``)

        Only used for sub-day timeframes to for example work on an hourly
        timeframe by specifying "TimeFrame.Minutes" and 60 as compression

        If ``None`` then the compression of the 1st data of the system will be
        used

      - headers (default: ``False``)

        Add an initial key to the dictionary holding the results with the names
        of the datas ('Datetime' as key

      - cash (default: ``False``)

        Include the actual cash as an extra position (for the header 'cash'
        will be used as name)

    Methods:

      - get_analysis

        Returns a dictionary with returns as values and the datetime points for
        each return as keys
