class DrawDown(bt.TimeFrameAnalyzerBase):
    '''This analyzer calculates trading system drawdowns on the chosen
    timeframe which can be different from the one used in the underlying data
    Params:

      - ``timeframe`` (default: ``None``)
        If ``None`` the ``timeframe`` of the 1st data in the system will be
        used

        Pass ``TimeFrame.NoTimeFrame`` to consider the entire dataset with no
        time constraints

      - ``compression`` (default: ``None``)

        Only used for sub-day timeframes to for example work on an hourly
        timeframe by specifying "TimeFrame.Minutes" and 60 as compression

        If ``None`` then the compression of the 1st data of the system will be
        used
      - *None*

    Methods:

      - ``get_analysis``

        Returns a dictionary (with . notation support and subdctionaries) with
        drawdown stats as values, the following keys/attributes are available:

        - ``drawdown`` - drawdown value in 0.xx %
        - ``maxdrawdown`` - drawdown value in monetary units
        - ``maxdrawdownperiod`` - drawdown length

      - Those are available during runs as attributes
        - ``dd``
        - ``maxdd``
        - ``maxddlen``
