class BTBroker(with_metaclass(MetaBtBroker, BrokerBase)):
    '''Broker implementation for Interactive Brokers.

    This class maps the orders/positions from Interactive Brokers to the
    internal API of ``backtrader``.

    Notes:

      - ``tradeid`` is not really supported, because the profit and loss are
        taken directly from IB. Because (as expected) calculates it in FIFO
        manner, the pnl is not accurate for the tradeid.

      - Position

        If there is an open position for an asset at the beginning of
        operaitons or orders given by other means change a position, the trades
        calculated in the ``Strategy`` in cerebro will not reflect the reality.

        To avoid this, this broker would have to do its own position
        management which would also allow tradeid with multiple ids (profit and
        loss would also be calculated locally), but could be considered to be
        defeating the purpose of working with a live broker
